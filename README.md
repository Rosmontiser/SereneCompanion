# SereneCompanion

SereneCompanion is an intelligent emotional support assistant designed to integrate with smart wearable devices for mood and emotion detection. Leveraging LoRA fine-tuning on the Qwen2.5-Omni model, it provides empathetic and context-aware interactions through mobile applications, assisting users during periods of emotional fluctuation.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Multimodal Understanding**: Utilizes Qwen2.5-Omni's Thinker-Talker architecture to process and interpret text, audio, visual, and video inputs, enabling comprehensive emotional context recognition.

- **Real-Time Interaction**: Designed for real-time engagement, supporting chunked inputs and immediate outputs, facilitating seamless user experiences.

- **Natural and Robust Speech Generation**: Employs advanced speech synthesis techniques to deliver responses that are both natural and resilient to various input conditions.

- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Implements Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) techniques to fine-tune the model effectively, ensuring optimal performance on resource-constrained devices.

- **Flexible Deployment**: The model can be deployed either on-device for offline functionality or in the cloud for more intensive processing tasks, depending on specific application requirements.

## 📱 Deployment Strategy

While wearable devices are utilized for detecting users' emotional states, the primary interaction with the SereneCompanion model occurs through a mobile application. Depending on the computational requirements and desired responsiveness, the model can be deployed:

- **On-Device**: For scenarios requiring offline access or enhanced privacy, a lightweight version of the model can be integrated directly into the mobile application.

- **Cloud-Based**: For more complex processing and to leverage greater computational resources, the model can be hosted on cloud servers, with the mobile application communicating via secure APIs.
